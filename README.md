I created a file named Hello.txt in my folder on my desktop.
I opened my powershell window and I changed into the folder I created "cd desktop/PLPBasicAssignment
Then I initialized it with git init
then I did git status to see the file
I then git add Hello.txt
also git commit -m "PLPBasicAssignment"
git pust -u origin master
